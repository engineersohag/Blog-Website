(12, 'Two pages ripped, an entire nation torn apart', '<p>A couple of days back, I woke up to video clips on Facebook showing a furious man ripping pages from a book and encouraging hundreds of onlookers to follow suit. Curious, I dove in to find the original 11-minute video, only to discover that the <a href=\"https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/sharifas-tale-education-ministry-forms-5-member-probe-committee-3527161\" target=\"_blank\">reason behind this</a> viral stunt was an excerpt from the Class 7&nbsp;<em>Itihash O Samajik Biggyan</em>&nbsp;(History and Social Science) textbook which discussed the need to respect and include people from gender-diverse communities, specifically those from the Hijra community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was all the more surprising when I found out who this enraged man was: Asif Mahtab Utsha, apparently an adjunct faculty member at BRAC University. Seeing an educator from a top private university openly disrespect an NCTB book at a Jatiyo Shikkhok Forum event was quite ironic. And, needless to say, appalling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAiECW73usLivqPCSeQRsSUvRQqFAgKIhAlu97rC4r6jwknkEbElL0U\"><img alt=\"Google News Link\" src=\"https://tds-images.thedailystar.net/sites/all/themes/tds/images/google_news.svg\" style=\"height:30px; margin-bottom:-3px; margin-right:15px\" />For all latest news, follow The Daily Star&#39;s Google News channel. </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not to imply that we ought to police what others believe. People have the right to live life by their personal codes of morality, including abstaining from supporting certain causes and agendas. However, Asif crosses the line when he calls for forcibly imposing his beliefs onto others. And as the video continues to get thousands of likes, shares, and positive comments, I can&#39;t help but be concerned about the ramifications of his actions on the most vulnerable people in our society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/magic-madness/news/time-change-our-anti-hijra-bias-1829326\">Read more</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/magic-madness/news/time-change-our-anti-hijra-bias-1829326\">Time to change our anti-Hijra bias</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of the inciteful rhetoric he uses to describe marginalised communities, he ironically fails to respect the bare minimum required of an &quot;academic,&quot; which he claims to be: presenting factually correct information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly, Asif conflates the very basic difference between sexuality and gender, using them interchangeably. In fact, the text does not address homosexuality at all, which is illegal in Bangladesh. Yet, he claims that a government-approved textbook is somehow being used to &quot;indoctrinate&quot; children, which is a bewildering implication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He goes on to assert that 40 percent of children in the US are transgender. A quick Google search, however, reveals the real number to be <a href=\"https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/transgender-estimate-press-release/\">1.4 percent among US-American children aged 13 to 17 years</a>, according to a study by the University of California, Los Angeles. Asif also claimed that there is a law that supposedly ensures transgender people study at the same pace and in the same institutes as their cisgender counterparts. However, regrettable though that may be, no such law exists or is in the process of being drafted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/education/news/will-address-confusion-over-textbook-content-3526886\">Read more</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/education/news/will-address-confusion-over-textbook-content-3526886\">Will address confusion over textbook content</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>All of this is particularly problematic since Asif&#39;s role as an educator and academic lends him a strong veneer of legitimacy. If one is to proudly boast of being a graduate of a reputable university abroad and a lecturer at one of the more prestigious ones in Bangladesh, the least one can do is not conjure statistics from thin air. Misinformation like this is dangerous, especially in a country where credentials often take precedence over facts and reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as appalling as his complete disregard for the forces of reality are the extreme views he espouses. In his speech, Asif called for people of diverse genders to not be educated or employed. This is irresponsible coming from an educator who bears the very responsibility to guide people towards education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He then proceeds to cherry-pick an anecdote promoting &quot;inclusion&quot; of the Hijra community which he misconstrues as &quot;brainwashing&quot; children; an absurd premise since promoting the rights of certain groups does not imply that you &quot;become&quot; them&mdash;not that anyone can consciously choose to become someone they&#39;re not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/views/lets-talk-about-it/news/what-about-us-3264341\">Read more</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/views/lets-talk-about-it/news/what-about-us-3264341\">&#39;What about us?&#39;</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps Asif&#39;s most outrageous claim was the idea that legal gender identification would somehow encourage sexual assault. He intuits that a &quot;biological male&quot; identifying as a woman could get away with rape, given that the Penal Code 375 (which he incorrectly refers to as &quot;Penal Code 175&quot; during his speech) only defines rape as a crime carried out by men on women. Despite the absurdity of this hypothesis, it&#39;s astonishing that a &quot;philosopher&quot; such as Asif Mahtab fails to realise the most obvious logical fallacy: this isn&#39;t an argument against gender diversity, it&#39;s an argument to reform the dated rape laws made by British colonialists 164 years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The consequences of Asif&#39;s actions aren&#39;t hypothetical. From the hashtag #BoycottBRAC to protests at the gates of the university, a movement of vindictive support for Asif has spread like wildfire, burning down the dignity and safety of marginalised communities. Every social media post claiming gender diversity to be a Western import contributes to the erasure of people who&#39;ve existed in the subcontinent under the umbrella term &quot;Hijra&quot; for centuries. Every meme misrepresents the cycles of systemic abuse they face to this day. I can&#39;t even fathom how difficult it must&#39;ve been for his gender-diverse students and co-workers to know that someone they had to see every day didn&#39;t even believe in their right to exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedailystar.net/views/opinion/news/hijra-it-derogatory-or-not-let-them-decide-3005261\">Read more</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.thedailystar.net/views/opinion/news/hijra-it-derogatory-or-not-let-them-decide-3005261\">&lsquo;Hijra&rsquo;: Is it derogatory or not? Let them decide.</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to recognise that ignorance cannot be an excuse for Asif&#39;s behaviour. BRAC University actively engages in initiatives such as gender sensitisation sessions for employees and health camps conducted for the transgender community. Asif has had every opportunity to educate himself and better his behaviour; he simply chose not to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the aftermath of his speech going viral, Asif was dismissed from BRAC University. And while this marks a step in the right direction, it&#39;s important to recognise that Asif&#39;s actions were not spontaneous. In the past, he has faced backlash for similar controversies, like when he tried to <a href=\"https://www.dhakatribune.com/around-the-web/142410/facebook-post-justifying-rape-triggers-public\">justify rape</a> publicly via his social media account. So while we commend BRAC&#39;s swift response, we must simultaneously expect our educational institutions to pay closer attention to whom they&#39;re allowing to shape the minds of our future generation. Moreover, we&#39;re often far too quick to jump to conclusions ourselves and take sides without ever really examining what our stances represent. Thus, the responsibility to maintain nuanced and inclusive discourse falls, in part, on ourselves. Before we jump onto another bandwagon, let&#39;s remember to do our research and listen to the students who are most likely to spot red flags such as those demonstrated by Asif Mahtab. As everyday internet users and responsible citizens, let us not allow one voice of intolerance to tear apart an entire nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Sadman Sakib</strong>&nbsp;is a student who has written under a pseudonym.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em>Views expressed in this article are the author&#39;s own.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n', 'ai-generated.jpg', 1, 5, '2024-01-25 12:26:48'),

But the supply situation has worsened in the past two weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAiECW73usLivqPCSeQRsSUvRQqFAgKIhAlu97rC4r6jwknkEbElL0U\"><img alt=\"Google News Link\" src=\"https://tds-images.thedailystar.net/sites/all/themes/tds/images/google_news.svg\" style=\"height:30px; margin-bottom:-3px; margin-right:15px\" />For all latest news, follow The Daily Star&#39;s Google News channel. </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At present, the government supplies 2,500 million cubic feet of gas per day (mmcfd), the lowest since April 2020, against a demand of 3,800 mmcfd, data from state-run Petrobangla showed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The acute gas crisis has crippled the textile and garment sectors, which may not bode well for the country as they account for 85 percent of Bangladesh&#39;s exports and have created millions of jobs, mainly for the poor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the onset of winter, the power sector&#39;s demand for gas has subsided, but that does not mean the other sectors are getting more gas because of a drop in local production and fewer imports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The shortage has hit hard industrial belts such as Narayanganj, Rupganj and Bhulta, forcing many factories to either keep production shut for long hours or run operations with expensive diesel in order to retain customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the textile mills, which are usually gas guzzlers, in Savar, Ashulia, Gazipur, Maona and Narsingdi are running at 30 to 40 percent capacity because of the gas crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, textile millers have to spend $1 on fuel in order to make export-bound goods worth $2. When the gas supply is normal, they would ship goods worth $40 with the same expenditure on energy, industry people say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Usually, I export $20 million worth of garment items a month but the production has fallen. This will bring down exports to $10 million,&quot; said a composite garment factory owner in Bhulta. The company produces finished garments from cotton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At its peak, it can produce 160 tonnes of yarn per day. However, the output has plunged to 60 tonnes, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, the factory can dye 90,000 metres of fabrics a day against a capacity of more than 2.5 lakh metres. Similarly, the output of the fabric mill has fallen to 90,000 metres against the capacity of 2.5 lakh metres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I am running my mills not to make any profits but to maintain the flow of work orders from international buyers,&quot; the owner said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said the yarn production capacity of the five largest textile mills in Bhulta and Gausia of Narayanganj is 1,000 tonnes per day. But they have been producing 300 tonnes daily for the last 15 days owing to a fall in gas supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mohammad Ali Khokon, president of the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association, said there is zero pressure of gas for several hours in some factories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mohammad Hatem, executive president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA), said the worst-affected industries are located in Narayanganj.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nearly 500 garment factories in the industrial belt have almost zero output, said several owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The situation prompted the BKMEA to write to the prime minister on Sunday, calling for immediate steps to ride out the energy crunch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The severity of the energy crisis has hit industries and businesses at a time when they are already weighed down by a sharp depreciation of the local currency, a shortage of US dollars needed to settle import payments, and a rising bank interest rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Owing to a significant fall in the foreign currency reserves, the taka has lost its value by about 30 percent against the US dollar in the past two years, which has made imports costlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, because of the withdrawal of the ceiling on lending rates in July, the cost of funds has gone up in the banking sector after remaining capped at 9 percent for more than three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The cost of doing business has climbed due to the significant appreciation of the dollar,&quot; said Humayun Rashid, president of the International Business Forum of Bangladesh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We, the businessmen, are adopting various mechanisms to optimise efficiency to tackle the ongoing crisis.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rashid, also the managing director of Energypac Power Generation Limited, said the dollar shortage, the gas crisis, and the increase in bank interest have affected businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;One challenge is coming after another. As a result, businesses are finding it tough to survive.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Entrepreneurs in the leather footwear sector say although leather, the key raw material for the industry, can be sourced domestically, most of the chemicals and accessories needed to manufacture finished goods for both local and export markets need to be imported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The packaging industry has seen an output decline of 25 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Demand has decreased like in other sectors,&quot; said Safius Sami Alamgir, president of the Bangladesh Flexible Packaging Industries Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subir Kumar Ghose, chief executive officer of Partex Petro Ltd, said the overall import cost in the energy sector has increased by 10 to 12 percent due to the depreciation of the taka.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Md Fazlul Hoque, managing director of Maona-based Israq Textile Mills Ltd, said their yarn production fell to 70 tonnes a day against a capacity of 110 tonnes because of the lower gas pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hatem said the volatile exchange rate, the higher cost of financing, and the severe gas crisis are hitting the industries so badly that many owners may turn defaulters if they can&#39;t continue smooth production and export on time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Industry people and analysts say a higher production cost will translate into higher prices of finished goods, meaning local consumers, who are grappling with an elevated level of inflation for the past 18 months, could see another spike in their cost-of-living.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the prices are raised to absorb the higher cost of production, Bangladesh may also emerge as an unattractive supplier to global markets. As a result, sales may fall, both at home and abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exports grew at 0.84 percent in the first half of the current financial year. It rose 6.67 percent in the last financial year, which ended in June.</p>\r\n', 'cvx.png', 9, 1, '2024-01-25 12:56:53'),
